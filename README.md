# CSES problems in Rust

I'm trying to solve as many problems as I can from the [CSES problemset](https://cses.fi/problemset/) in Rust. Hopefully I'll be able to learn Rust and also get better at competitive programming by doing this.

Each problem I've solved can be run with cargo:

```fish
cargo run --bin problem_name
```
